# The Asteroid Field
---

The asteroid field is a DeFi yield farming platform where you can stake your LP's and get $JUMP tokens as a reward!

(Unlike the vaults, you will get $JUMP tokens as a reward and the amount of LP will not grow automatically)

### **The community and the asteroid field**

Community will decide and vote on the staggered rewards in each chain to maintain a better balance between supply and demand.

From the Mother Chain, tokens will be distributed to all the farms on various other chains by a Multi-Chain Distributor Contract. In the spirit of a true DAO, and to give the $HYPR and $AURORA tokens a quality use case, the distribution of our multi-chain token will be periodically voted on by our community to make sure the balance across chains is just right, The power will be in your hands!

For example, if Fantom is over performing then the community could boost the Fantom farm share and if Binance Smarth Chain is under performing, we can reduce its share. The idea is to have balance between universes and give our decentralized community the power to make real and significant changes when needed. This is the exact strategy used in the gold market to maintain balance, but without the voting from the community.

### **Features and farm fees (NO FEES!)**

The Asteroid Field also can sync Jump reward ratio to optimize farms with available supply and arrives with an improved fee system! We took our competitive current fees and went completely angry on them resulting in:

0 FEES ON DEPOSITS OR WITHDRAWALS! GRRRRRR NO FEES!!!

### **Hidden Feature**

The Asteroid Field we have a hidden feature within the code in the future with a bounty and a great reward! Any project or dev that finds the hidden feature, we will have a farm for them or their favorite project provided by HyperJump!
