# HyperHeist

## Getting Started **HyperHeist**

Players must pay 0.25$ to play a game, payments must be made in BUSD if you are using BinanceSmathChain or USDC if you are using Fantom network; at the end of the week the funds obtained will be used to buy back and burn farming tokens and reward the top 5 players with the highest scores, the distribution will be this:

* 30% Buyback and Burn $JUMPüî•
* TOP 1 - 25% ü•á
* TOP 2 - 17% ü•à
* TOP 3 - 13% ü•â
* TOP 4 - 10% üí∞
* TOP 5 - 5% üí∞

This System gives a buying force to $JUMP, it reduces the total supply, increases the JUMP buy force, the game price keeps stable and the winners can‚Äôt have a selling pressure to the tokens to take their profits, Everyone wins!

*In case the incoming rewards are not enough to cover the network fees or there are few winners, then the payments will be made after the necessary number of players join*

### **How to play HyperHeist?**

The objective is to collect the materials from the dispensers, for this we must approach the dispensers with materials and wait 2.1 seconds while we fully load the materials\*\*.\*\*

Once the materials are collected we need to return to the base and we will have completed the wave! We can always use the map to orient ourselves, the objectives will appear highlighted there.

When we complete missions, our score will grow exponentially, we can also get 100 additional points for each enemy ship (Minions) that we destroy, so, if you see a minion, Destroy it!

### **Vending Machine**

It is probably one of the most important points of the whole game, here we can get better weapons for our ship and health when we need it, every time we use it we will have to pay 4000 points, we will get a random item each time (health, green laser or blue laser) and we can use it a maximum of 3 times, then it will turn black and no more items will be given.

### **The Boss! ‚öîÔ∏è**

The boss will appear in waves 4 and 8 (make sure you get a good weapon on the vending machine before face him), When it appears, the access to the tunnel and the vending machine will be blocked until it is destroyed, we can only harm him when his shield is not activated, and its laser has a very high range, be careful there crew!

## Playing HyperHeist like a pro!

### **Minion ships!**

They will follow you and try to destroy your ship, red falcon is resistant up to 37 minion shots!

* The shots could make you back off
* There will be more enemies in each wave
* Try to avoid the minions shots
* Use tunnels smartly to destroy them

### Vending Machine Pro! üé∞

You can decide between taking the upgrade that you got or leaving it there to take advantage of it later when it seems more convenient (the object could disappear).

If you are at wave 3 and you do not find a better weapon, destroy more minions to get 4000 points and try again on the vending machine.

Those are very easy things that can help us a lot to improve our game!

### Sweeping

This technique consists on turning around in the circle of the map, shooting non-stop only the enemies in front of the ship

After a while, all enemies will be together behind you, and it will be much easier to collect materials ‚öôÔ∏è

### Collecting Materials Like a Pro! üöÄ

To fully collect materials the ship must spend approximately 2.1 seconds collecting materials at the depo, But time does not necessarily need to be continuously, you can partially collect the materials until you achieve a total time of 2.1 seconds

### Beating the Boss! üó°Ô∏è

* The first thing you should do is avoid placing yourself in front of him
* When the boss appears, stand behind him and shoot without stop
* Focus on beating the boss rather than destroying the Minions
* Try to get a better weapon before you face him
