# Fiat On Ramp

![](../.gitbook/assets/Onramper.png)

HyperJumpâ€™s Onramper allows you to let your users buy crypto directly on your website or app. Onramper is a fiat-to-crypto gateway aggregator, which implements all major gateways in a single solution. This allows businesses to get global coverage of supported countries, payment methods, cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. At the same time, businesses are free to implement their own fees on every user transaction

Currently, the integrated gateways are:

* Moonpay
* Wyre
* Xanpool
* Mercuryo
* Coinify
* Indacoin
* BTCDirect (live Soon)
* Ramp Network (live Soon)
* Transak (live Soon)

We'll continue to contract with and integrate additional gateways. We'll also be adding an offramp soon (allowing users to sell crypto for fiat)!

#### FEES

Users pay fees for the conversion to the chosen fiat gateway. Additionally, end-users pay 1% of the tx to Onramper. However, end-users still pay less in fees than without Onramper as we ensure the lowest fee gateway will always be available for their transactions, which usually saves users far more than 1%. Additionally, Onramper procures lower rates than normally charged by gateways.
