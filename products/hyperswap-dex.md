# HyperSwap (DEX)

HyperSwap is an Automatic Market Maker on Binance Smart Chain and Fantom Chains.&#x20;

On BSC, it stands out from the competition as it collects a total of 0.4% for swap fees, of which the **full 0.3% is paid to existing LPs and the other 0.1% is used to buy-back and burn $JUMP**.&#x20;

Similarly on Fantom, it collects a total of 0.2% for swap fees, of which the **full 0.15% is paid to existing LPs and the other 0.05% is used to buy-back and burn $JUMP**.

### **LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS (LPs)**

Liquidity can be provided on HyperSwap by pooling two different tokens of which the amount will be automatically calculated based on the underlying price of each.&#x20;

After providing liquidity, LP tokens are received which can be staked in the corresponding staking pools in The Asteroid Field to earn $JUMP ** (BSC) or $JUMP ** (FTM).

To create LP tokens (usually for a specific farm) follow this process:

1. Verify that the correct amount of tokens are in your wallet
2. Go to [ ](https://ftm.hyperjump.app/swap)[HyperSwap](https://ftm.hyperjump.app/swap) and connect your wallet
3. Click LIQUIDITY at the top of the swap interface to bring up the LP token list
4. Click ADD LIQUIDITY or check your list of LP tokens below (they don't show here when staked)
5. Add the amounts of the tokens you would like to use to create LP tokens and review the details
6. If any tokens need approval, click APPROVE for those tokens
7. Once approved, click SUPPLY

Congratulations, you now have LP tokens in your wallet.  These tokens are earning fees from the swap they were created on. In this case, HyperSwap pays LP holders a full 0.3%(BSC)/0.15(FTM) of the fees from transactions.\
One of the best rates of return on Binance Smart Chain.

In addition to receiving fees, you can stake LP tokens in farms to earn more benefits. HyperSwap LPs can be used in [The Asteroid Field](https://ftm.hyperjump.app/farms).

#### **IMPERMANENT LOSS**

Impermanent loss occurs when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. The bigger this change is, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss. In this case, the loss means less dollar value at the time of withdrawal than at the time of deposit.

### **UNIQUE, BEST-IN-CLASS USER EXPERIENCE**&#x20;

HyperSwap team go normally extra miles to provide unique, best-in-class user experience for users. Examples of such details:

* Whenever a user swap a native-supported token, after the swap, there is a UI popup to allow the user to add the icon of the token to their MetaMask wallet. (Illustrated below)
* There is a "volume" like button, so that users could enable/disable the cool sounds for the swap.
