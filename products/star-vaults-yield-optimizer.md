# Star Vaults (Yield Optimizer)

## What are StarVaults?

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)



Vaults are investment instruments that employ a specific set of strategies for yield farming. They make use of automation to continually invest and reinvest deposited funds, which help to achieve high levels of compounded interest.

In other words, StarVaults are a simple and efficient way to farm without additional manual actions. You simply deposit your tokens, and the StarVaults take care of the rest to guarantee you the best possible interest.

StarVaults will be harvested at regular time intervals (every 4 hours on BSC, every 15 mins on Fantom), and all profits are reinvested to guarantee better yields. To track your gains, take note of your initial deposit, it will grow with every harvest and compound the system does.
