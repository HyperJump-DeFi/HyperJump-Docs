HyperAurora (AURORA) is the flagship token of HyperJump on Fantom that delivers instant passive yield directly to user wallets. It is a deflationary token with a burn on every transaction with the exception of buying.

### Initial Supply

The initial supply for $AURORA was 10 million tokens.

The supply will only get smaller in every transaction (except the buying)

### The Burn

Every transaction of $AURORA, with the exception of buying, is subject to the burning mechanism. The burn percentage is based on a curve against the price of FTM.

* The highest percentage is 15% based on 50 $AURORA per FTM
* The lowest possible burn is 0.5%

#### The burn occurs on all of the following transactions:

* Selling on a DEX
* Sending from one wallet to another.
* Adding or removing liquidity to/from an AMM.

#### Burn Reward Distribution

50% of all burns are distributed to holders of HyperAurora (AURORA) instantly. The percentage of fees earned is calculated by the percentage of $AURORA that each owner holds.

No action is needed for holders to receive the fees. The amount of $AURORA increases right in their wallet.\\

#### Burned from Supply

25% of all burns are removed from supply permanently. This causes a constant reduction of supply making $AURORA highly deflationary.
