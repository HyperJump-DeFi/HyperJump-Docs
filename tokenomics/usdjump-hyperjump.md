# $JUMP - HyperJump

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

$JUMP is HyperJump’s reDEFIned multi-chain farming token created on Fantom Network and distributed to other chains through a multi-chain distributor contract. $JUMP has a limited total supply pre-minted at the token creation, therefore no more tokens will be minted again in the future.

$JUMP is bridged to other chains by a tight integration between the Multi-Chain Distributor Contract and the Synapse Bridge; The distributor will manage and maintain the balances across chains based on the current distribution model by handling the transfer, unlock and burn across the Synapse bridge. This will make the APY and rewards across all chains unified into one management system while preventing many common attacks on cross chain tokens all at the same time.

### How Is $JUMP Better Than $ALLOY And $ORI?

* **$JUMP is a token with capped supply**. This means there a definite number of $JUMP tokens that will ever exist. $ALLOY and $ORI didn’t have a capped supply and could be minted indefinitely.
* **$JUMP is now featured on each dApp of HyperJump ecosystem.** Users from HyperSwap and Star Vaults are now earning $JUMP for using our platform.
* With **burning and limited supply** $JUMP is now more valuable than ever.
* **$JUMP is a single cross chain token**, while $ALLOY and $ORI were separate tokens on specific chains.
