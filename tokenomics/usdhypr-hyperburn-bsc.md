HyperBurn ($HYPR) is the flagship token of HyperJump on Binance Smarth Chain that delivers instant passive yield directly to user wallets. It is a deflationary token with a burn on every transaction with the exception of buying.

### Initial Supply

The initial supply for $HYPR was 1 million tokens.

The supply will only get smaller in every transaction (except the buying)

### The Burn

Every transaction of $HYPR, with the exception of buying, is subject to the burning mechanism. The burn percentage is based on a curve against the price of BNB.&#x20;

* The highest percentage is 33.33% based on 50 $HYPR per BNB
* The lowest possible burn is 0.5%

#### The burn occurs on all of the following transactions:

* Selling on a DEX
* Sending from one wallet to another.
* Adding or removing liquidity to/from an AMM.

### Burn Reward Distribution

50% of all burns are distributed to holders of HyperBurn (HYPR) instantly. The percentage of fees earned is calculated by the percentage of $HYPR that each owner holds.

No action is needed for holders to receive the fees. The amount of $HYPR increases right in their wallet.

#### &#x20;Burned from Supply

25% of all burns are removed from supply permanently. This causes a constant reduction of supply making $HYPR highly deflationary.

#### Burned to Development Fund

25% of all burns go back to HyperJump for promotion and further development.&#x20;
