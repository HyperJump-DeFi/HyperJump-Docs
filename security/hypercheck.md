# HyperCheck



HyperJump is a team dedicated to make Crypto-space free from rug pull and scams happening everyday. We have a team of contract readers who check every project we partner with. We have had this check ongoing since day one of partnering with other projects, but now we are making it publicly available as a service to other projects.

(The HyperCheck code review does not replace a full-fledged code audit, but it is meant to provide users with a succinct rundown of the project contracts and point out any red flags (rug pulls) that could cost our investors in the community funds.)
