### Set-up your Wallet

To get started on HyperJump, the first thing you will need is to set up a wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

When you are setting up a wallet, follow the guide carefully and make sure you safely backup your recovery phrases.

We recommend the below wallets for simple setup and ease of use:

### How to Get BNB?

The native tokens of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) are BEP20.

To do most things on BSC, you will need to pay gas, which comes in the form of BEP20 BNB.

You will also need the BEP20 version of any token you want to trade, stake etc on BSC.

You can go a few ways about converting your tokens to BEP20, but here are the ones we recommend:

ðŸ”’ SafePal  - You don't need an account, or to register etc. Execute cross-chain swaps directly from your wallet.

ðŸ“– (https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/guides/bridge-v2.html)

ðŸ’° Binance.com - You can withdraw tokens as BEP20 via your Binance account (if you have one). Bear in mind you need an account to do so.&#x20;
